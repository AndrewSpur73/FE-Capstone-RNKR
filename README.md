RNKR [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1f5a7edf-2264-44bd-b397-f109b7857b9b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rnkr/deploys)

# Overview

RNKR is an application that allows a user to save and keep up with all their games, specifically competitive ranked games, across all consoles. A user can save their current rank (if applicable), the console they play it on, and whether it's one of their favorite games.

## About the User
- The ideal user for this application is a gamer.
- They play many games, sometimes on many different consoles, and would like to keep track of them all in one place.
- They also play many ranked games and would like to keep track of them in one place.
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to keep all their played game details in one place. When playing on a console, you can only view the games, and ranks from those games, that you have played on that console. This means having to go to many different places to find the game information you are looking for.

## Features 
- When a new game is added an object should be created and that object should be pushed into an array of games that then prints to the DOM.
- Only the user's ranked games will appear immediately upon login.
- The user can navigate to their game library to view ALL games they have recorded, including the already viewed ranked games.
- The user can easily document new games and update their already existing games.
- A profile page will track the user's name, last login, and images of the currently saved games in their library. This page can be shared with friends to find games they both already have.
